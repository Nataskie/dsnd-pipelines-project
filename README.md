# Fashion Forward Forecasting

This project is part of Udacityâ€™s Data Science Nanodegree and focuses on building a complete machine learning pipeline using scikit-learn to predict whether a customer would recommend a women's clothing product based on their review.

### Dependencies

```
pandas
scikit-learn
spacy
notebook
```

### Installation

Step by step explanation of how to get a dev environment running.

List out the steps

```
1. Clone the repository: 
git clone https://github.com/udacity/dsnd-pipelines-project.git
cd dsnd-pipelines-project

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook starter/pipeline_project.ipynb

```

## Testing

There are no automated tests required. Test the model pipeline by:

Running the notebook end-to-end

Ensuring model_pipeline.fit() and model_pipeline.predict() 

Verifying model performance metrics are reported 

## Project Instructions

The notebook should:

Explore and visualize the data

Preprocess data using a unified pipeline

Train and tune a classification model

Evaluate performance with appropriate metrics

## Built With

scikit-learn - Machine learning models and pipelines

spaCy - NLP preprocessing

pandas - Data manipulation

Jupyter Notebook - Interactive development
